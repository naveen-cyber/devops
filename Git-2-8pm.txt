Git when working on the local system uses three sections
1 Working Directory or Workspace
2 Stagging Area
3 Local Repository

Working dir is the fodler where the code is created and intially the files present here are called untracked files

Stagging Area is the intermediated buffer zone of git where the files are temporarly moved into and these files are called indexed files

Local Repository is the location where version controlling happens and files from stagging area are sent into the local repository
Files present here are called commited files

1 To initilise the working dir as a git repository
  git init
  This will create a hidden fodler called .git where it will store   all the configuration that are necessary for git to run

2 To send a files from working dir to stagging area
  git add filename
  To send multiple files
  git add file1 file2 file3
  To send all the files and folders into the stagging area
  git add .
  Note . represents present working directory

3 To bring files back from stagging area to untracked section
  git rm --cached filename
  (or)
  git reset filename

4 To send files from stagging area to local repository
  git commit -m "Some message"

5 To see the status of the untracked section and stagging area
  git status

6 To see the list of commits or commit history
  git log
  To see the commit history in shortend format
  git log --oneline
