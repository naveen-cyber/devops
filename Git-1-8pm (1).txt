Version Controlling
========================
This is the process of maintaining multiple versions of the code
All the team members upload their code in a remote version controlling
system.The VCS accepts the code uploads from multiple team members and it
creates one integrated project out of those uploaded.The process of uploading
into the VCS is known as checkin.The next time when the team members download the code from the VCS they can access all the code created by the entire team

VCS's also preserve older and later versions of the code so that at any point
of time we can togle between any version.

VCS's keep a track of who is making what kind of changes at what time

VCS's are classified into 2 type
1 Centralised Version Controlling
2 Distributed Version Controlling

Centralised Version Controlling concept:
==================================
Here we have a remote server where version controlling happens.All the team
members simple checkin their code into this remote server.Only in the remote server version controlling happens

Distributed Version Controlling
===================================
Here we have a local repository installed on every team memebers machine.
The code is initially pushed by a individual team member into the local
repository running on his machine where version controlling happens at the level of individual team memeber.From here the code is uploaded into a remote
server where version controlling happens at the level of the entire team.



Installing git on Windows
=============================
1 Open https://git-scm.com/download/win
2 Download git for Windows--->Install it
3 Once git is installed we get an application called as git bash
  This is the command prompt of git where we can execute all the git commands

Installing git on Ubuntu
===========================
1 Open terminal
2 Update the apt repository
  sudo apt-get update
3 Install git
  sudo apt-get install -y git

Installing on RHEL or Centos
=================================
1 Open terminal
2 Update the yum repository
  sudo yum -y update
3 Install git
  sudo yum install -y git


Setting username and email globally for all users
======================================================
git config --global user.name "sai krishna"
git config --global user.email "intelliqittrainings@gmail.com"

To see the list of all the global configurations
git config --global -list
